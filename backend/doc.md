This entire template has one goal, to create a very lightweight fastapi production template that is extensible and can be used anywhere. Most applications use postgres, i want to remove all the hassle from setting up a new fastapi project and getting it to a point where it can be deployed to production.

existing solutions are either old or very lackluster, or very very complex(the offical template which also locks you in to many technologies and even has a frontend smh smh)

I want something anyone can use off the bat that is reliable which requires minimal configuration. 

we need to fix three things:

a. DB migration probably with alembic
b. structured logging
c. easy to opt out of observabiliyt
d. fix the rate limiting which is a bit dodgy
